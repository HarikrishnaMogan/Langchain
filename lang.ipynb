The amount of scattering that occurs depends on the wavelength of the light.

      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it consists of a broad spectrum of colors, including all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\n",
      "2. **Light encounters tiny molecules**: The sunlight encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n",
      "3. **Scattering occurs**: When light hits these tiny molecules, it scatters in all directions. The amount of scattering that occurs depends on the wavelength of the light. Shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange).\n",
      "4. **Blue light is scattered more**: Because blue light has a shorter wavelength (around 450-495 nanometers), it is scattered more than other colors. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\n",
      "5. **Our eyes perceive the blue color**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions. This is why the sky appears blue to our eyes, especially during the daytime when the sun is overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that the color of the sky can vary depending on the time of day, atmospheric conditions, and the amount of dust and pollution in the air. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* During sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the scattering of light by atmospheric particles.\n",
      "* On a cloudy day, the sky can appear gray or white due to the scattering of light by water droplets or ice crystals in the clouds.\n",
      "* In areas with high levels of air pollution, the sky can appear more hazy or brown due to the scattering of light by particles in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that helps! Do you have any other questions about the sky or light?"

      "* **Dust and pollution**: Tiny particles in the atmosphere can scatter light in different ways, making the sky appear more hazy or gray.\n",
      "* **Clouds**: Clouds can reflect and scatter light, changing the color of the sky.\n",
      "* **Time of day**: The color of the sky can change during sunrise and sunset, when the light has to travel through more of the atmosphere, scattering off more molecules and taking on a reddish hue.\n",

      "content='Once upon a time, in a small, spooky town, there lived a little girl named Lily. She was a curious and brave girl, with a heart full of wonder and a mind full of questions. One dark and stormy night, Lily decided to explore the abandoned mansion on the hill, a place that was rumored to be haunted by ghosts and monsters.\\n\\nAs she walked up the creaky steps and pushed open the creaky door, a chill ran down her spine. The wind howled and the trees creaked, making it sound like someone was whispering her name. Lily stepped inside, her flashlight casting eerie shadows on the walls.\\n\\nSuddenly, she heard a strange noise, like footsteps coming from the floor above. Lily\\'s heart started racing, but she didn\\'t want to be scared. She took a deep breath and began to climb the stairs, her eyes fixed on the door at the top.\\n\\nAs she reached the top, she saw a figure standing in the doorway. It was a ghostly girl, with eyes that glowed like embers and hair that flowed like the wind. Lily was frozen in terror, but the ghostly girl didn\\'t seem scary at all. In fact, she looked sad and lonely.\\n\\n\"Who are you?\" Lily asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\\n\\n\"I am Emily,\" the ghostly girl replied, her voice like a whisper on the wind. \"I\\'ve been trapped in this house for many years, waiting for someone to set me free.\"\\n\\nLily\\'s fear began to fade, replaced by a sense of curiosity and compassion. She asked Emily what she needed to do to set her free, and Emily told her that she needed to find a locket that was hidden somewhere in the house.\\n\\nLily searched the house from top to bottom, solving puzzles and riddles along the way. Finally, she found the locket, hidden in a secret room behind a bookshelf. As she opened the locket, a bright light filled the room, and Emily\\'s ghostly form began to fade.\\n\\n\"Thank you, Lily,\" Emily said, her voice barely audible. \"You have set me free. I can finally rest in peace.\"\\n\\nAnd with that, Emily disappeared, leaving Lily alone in the dark and dusty house. But Lily didn\\'t feel scared or alone. She felt brave and proud, knowing that she had helped a lost soul find peace.

The Cybertruck has been criticized for its production quality and safety concerns while its sales have been described as disappointing.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Background ===\\nTesla CEO Elon Musk\\'s ideas for a pickup truck were first stated publicly in 2012 and 2013, envisioning to build a \"Tesla supertruck with crazy torque, dynamic air suspension, and corners like it\\'s on rails\". In early 2014 Musk predicted 4–5 years before work could start on the product, then in a 2015 interview with CNN, Musk stated that the Tesla pickup would be the equivalent of a Ford F-150. In mid-2016, the outline for a consumer pickup truck was included in part 2 of the Tesla Master Plan. Musk suggested that the same chassis could be used for a van and a pickup truck. In 2017, Musk teased the picture of a \"pickup truck that can carry a pickup truck\" was displayed at the official reveal for the Tesla Semi and Roadster.\\nIn March 2019, following the Tesla Model Y launch, Musk distributed a teaser image of a vehicle described as having a cyberpunk or Blade Runner style, with the form resembling a futuristic armored personnel carrier. It was rumored to be named the Model B. On November 6, 2019, Tesla filed for a trademark on \"Cybrtrk\", which was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office but was later abandoned on August 10, 2020.\\n\\n\\n=== 2019 concept ===\\n\\nA concept Cybertruck was unveiled in Los Angeles, California, on November 21, 2019—the same month, year, and location in which the movie Blade Runner was set. The Cybertruck was launched under a graffiti-themed \"Cybertruck\" logo.\\nDuring the unveiling, Tesla claimed that the Cybertruck\\'s \"Armor Glass\" windows were virtually unbreakable, but two windows shattered when Franz von Holzhausen threw a metal ball at each of them. Musk later claimed that the windows were damaged because, in an earlier demonstration, the door had been hit by a sledgehammer that cracked the base of the glass. Tesla released a video of Cybertruck pulling a rear-wheel-drive Ford F-150 uphill in a tug of war. News outlets pointed out this was due to the Cybertruck\\'s heavier weight.\\nTesla\\'s stated goal was to provide a sustainable energy substitute for the roughly 6,500 fossil-fuel-powered pickup-trucks sold per day in the United States.\\nAt the end of the presentation, a concept Tesla Cyberquad all-terrain vehicle (ATV) was driven onto the bed of the Cybertruck using a built-in ramp in the tailgate. The Cyberquad was plugged into the Cybertruck\\'s onboard power outlet to charge its batteries. The ATV was anticipated for future sale as a Cybertruck option.\\n\\nIn 2019, many social media commentators criticized the sharp contours and unusual exterior shown in the concept vehicle. The prototype was exhibited at the Petersen Automotive Museum in June 2020 and returned in November 2022.\\n\\n\\n=== Reservations ===\\nBeginning in November 2019, Tesla accepted Cybertruck reservations with a refundable US$100 deposit. On November 23, 2019, Musk tweeted that Tesla had received 146,000 reservations in the first 1.5 days after the unveiling. Musk updated the number')]\n"
