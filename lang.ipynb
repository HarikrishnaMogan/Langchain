      "content=\"The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it consists of a spectrum of colors, including all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\\n2. **Light interacts with atmospheric molecules**: The sunlight encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\\n3. **Scattering occurs**: When light hits these small molecules, it scatters in all directions. The amount of scattering that occurs depends on the wavelength of the light. Shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange).\\n4. **Blue light is scattered more**: Because of its shorter wavelength, blue light is scattered in all directions by the atmospheric molecules. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\\n5. **Our eyes perceive the blue color**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions. This is why the sky appears blue to our eyes, especially during the daytime when the sun is overhead.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the sky can appear different colors under various conditions, such as:\\n\\n* During sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear more red or orange due to the scattering of light by atmospheric particles and the angle of the sun.\\n* At high altitudes or in areas with low humidity, the sky can appear more intense blue due to the reduced scattering of light.\\n* In areas with high levels of air pollution, the sky can appear more hazy or gray due to the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere.\\n\\nIn summary, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by small molecules in the atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths like blue being scattered more than longer wavelengths like red.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 438, 'prompt_tokens': 42, 'total_tokens': 480, 'completion_time': 0.839647324, 'prompt_time': 0.001939823, 'queue_time': 0.056935487, 'total_time': 0.841587147}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_eff2255fd7', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--7bd1c30b-4eeb-48b1-b27c-804dd737410c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 42, 'output_tokens': 438, 'total_tokens': 480}\n"
